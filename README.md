## Manage tasks demo

Run `npm install`, `npm run dev`, and go to http://localhost:3000/

Three main files:
- `src/page.tsx` - the main dashboard to show all tasks
- `src/components/Task.tsx` - the component to interact with each task
- `src/components/types.ts` - keep track of properties and requirements for each task
